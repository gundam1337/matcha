Matcha is a full-stack chat web application that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. This project showcases my skills in developing a complete web application from scratch, utilizing various technologies and frameworks for both the front-end and back-end.

## 🌟 Features

- ⚡ Real-time chat functionality
- 🔒 User authentication and authorization
- 📱 Responsive and intuitive user interface
- 🌐 Integration with Socket.IO for instant messaging
- 🛡️ Secure backend API with Express.js and MongoDB
- 🚀 Deployment-ready configuration

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### 🖥️ Front-end

- **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for managing application state
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests
- **Socket.IO Client**: A library for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between the browser and the server
- **Formik**: A library for building forms in React
- **Yup**: A JavaScript schema validation library
- **Styled Components**: A CSS-in-JS library for styling React components
- **Leaflet**: An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
- **React Router**: A routing library for navigating between different pages in a React application

### ⚙️ Back-end
🚀 Back-end Features
The back-end of this application is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust and scalable foundation. It incorporates the following features and technologies:

- **Real-time Communication**: Leveraging the power of Socket.IO, the back-end enables real-time communication between the server and clients. This allows for instant messaging, live updates, and seamless interaction within the application.
- **Authentication and Security**: User authentication and security are handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for password hashing. This ensures secure user registration, login, and authorization processes.
-**Database Management**: MongoDB is used as the database solution, with Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library. This allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of application data.
-**Caching with Redis**: Redis is employed as an in-memory data store for caching frequently accessed data. By caching key information, the application achieves improved performance and reduced latency.
-**Email Functionality**: Nodemailer is integrated to enable email sending capabilities. This allows for user notifications, password reset functionality, and other email-based features.
-**Logging and Monitoring**: Winston is utilized for logging purposes, providing comprehensive logging capabilities for monitoring application behavior and debugging.
-**Form Validation**: Express Validator is used for validating and sanitizing user input, ensuring data integrity and preventing potential security vulnerabilities.
-**Secure Headers**: Helmet is employed to secure Express applications by setting various HTTP headers, enhancing the application's security posture.
-**Faker.js**: Faker.js is included to generate realistic fake data for testing and development purposes, providing a convenient way to populate the application with sample data.
-**Firebase Admin SDK**: The Firebase Admin SDK is integrated to store user images securely. It provides a reliable and scalable storage solution, allowing users to upload and retrieve their profile pictures efficiently.
